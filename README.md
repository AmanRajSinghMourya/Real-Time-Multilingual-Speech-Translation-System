# Real-Time Multilingual Speech Translation System

This project implements a real-time multilingual speech translation system. It includes modules for audio capture, speech-to-text, text translation, and text-to-speech, providing a comprehensive pipeline for translating spoken language in real-time.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Run the Pipeline**: `python main.py`

## Directory Structure

- `audio_capture/`: Handles audio capture and preprocessing.
- `models/`: Contains pretrained models for STT, translation, and TTS.
- `real_time_processing/`: Integrates the pipeline components.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and classes.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for each module.
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts for dataset preparation and pipeline execution.
- `config/`: Configuration files for models and pipelines.
